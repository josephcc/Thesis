As people search online to plan trips or shop for new products, they encounter many entities (e.g., attractions, restaurants, camera models) and collect evidence across information sources to make informed decisions (e.g., travel blogs, top ten lists). Current browsers treat entities and evidence on each webpage independently of other pages, making it difficult for users to keep track of what they are interested in and why. We introduce Fusion, a novel browser add-on that weaves pages together through common entities using an in situ interface integrated into users' existing browsing experience. When users open a webpage, Fusion ``infuses'' it with information extracted from other webpages and knowledge bases relevant to entities on the current page. When users save notes about an entity, their notes are ``diffused'' across other pages where the same entity was mentioned. In evaluation, we found our participants valued the entity-centric approach that helped them gather, reuse, and accumulate evidence across webpages for multiple entities. Our findings have implications for the design of future browser interfaces.
