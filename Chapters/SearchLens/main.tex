While previous chapters focused on providing global context in the domain of crowdsourced sensemaking, starting with this chapter I shift focus to the domain of building interactive systems that can better support global context for individual's conducting online sensemaking tasks, such as trip planning or product comparison research. This is motivated by the application evaluation of Alloy described in \Cref{chap:ka}, were we found individuals valued articles synthesized from clusters generated by Alloy, suggesting that global context (i.e., information gathered and synthesized across information sources) is also highly valued by individuals conducting online research.

This chapter explore a novel approach to better support the personalization  aspects of data exploration. Using a restaurant review corpus, I focused on supporting users to learn from data and iteratively refine and evolve their nuanced interests. Consumer generated reviews are one of the most important influence in online decision making. To make sense of these rich repositories of diverse opinions, searchers need to sift through a large number of reviews to characterize each item based on aspects that they care about. We introduce a novel system, SearchLens, where searchers build up a collection of ``Lenses'' that reflect their different latent interests, and compose the Lenses to find relevant items across different contexts. Based on the Lenses, SearchLens generates personalized interfaces with visual explanations that promotes transparency and enables deeper exploration. While prior work found searchers may not wish to put in effort specifying their goals without immediate and sufficient benefits, results from a controlled lab study suggest that our approach incentivized participants to express their interests more richly than in a baseline condition, and a field study showed that participants found benefits in SearchLens while conducting their own tasks.
